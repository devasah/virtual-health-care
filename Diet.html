      <block>Benefits Of Eating Healthy Diet</block> 
   </h1>
 
<p style="font-size: 16;">A healthy diet may help to prevent certain serious diseases such as heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. It may also help to reduce your risk of developing some cancers. If you become sick, eating a healthy diet may help you to recover more quickly. Also, a main way of preventing obesity and overweight is to eat a healthy diet. A healthy diet typically includes nutrient-dense foods from all of the major food groups, including lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and fruits and vegetables of many colors. Healthy eating habits also include replacing foods that contain trans fats, added salt, and sugar with more nutritious options.</p>
   
Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood.

Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting nutrition and diet advice out there,   you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a certain food is good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the   opposite. The truth is that while some specific foods or nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall   dietary pattern that is most important. The cornerstone of a healthy diet should be to replace processed food with real food whenever   possible. Eating food that is as close as possible to the way nature made it can make a huge difference to the way you think, look, and feel.
